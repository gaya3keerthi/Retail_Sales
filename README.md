Effective data management is key to balancing customer satisfaction and profitability. Retailers use customer data to gauge success, employing metrics like conversion rates, average order value, recency of purchase, and total spending to understand customer behavior.

Customer intelligence involves transforming raw transactional and behavioral data into actionable insights, predicting future trends, and improving decision-making.

This practice is essential for large retailers, who utilize data analytics to track emerging products, forecast sales, optimize product placements and enhance promotional strategies.
